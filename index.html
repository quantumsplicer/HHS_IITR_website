                <p>
                    The Department of Humanities and Social Sciences in IIT Roorkee (erstwhile University of Roorkee)
                    was established in 1966 with a vision to integrate human values and social concerns with technical
                    education. Over the years, it has developed into a lively department, encompassing teaching and
                    research programs in the areas of English, Economics, Philosophy, Psychology, Sociology, Fine Arts
                    and related inter & cross disciplinary subjects. Seventy two scholars have been awarded the Ph.D.
                    degrees across different disciplines of the department. One of the notable achievements in recent
                    years has been the expansion in research activities and exchanges of ideas, facilitated by the
                    constant surge of discussions, consultations and publications in esteemed and high impact journals.
                    Besides, there has been considerable progression of tangible and scholastic infrastructure which in
                    process provides an impetus to its bright future.

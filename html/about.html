                <p>
                    The Department of Humanities and Social Sciences in IIT Roorkee (erstwhile University of Roorkee)
                    was established in 1966 with a vision to integrate human values and social concerns with technical
                    education. Over the years, it has developed into a lively department, encompassing teaching and
                    research programs in the areas of English, Economics, Philosophy, Psychology, Sociology, Fine Arts
                    and related inter & cross disciplinary subjects. Seventy two scholars have been awarded the Ph.D.
                    degrees across different disciplines of the department. One of the notable achievements in recent
                    years has been the expansion in research activities and exchanges of ideas, facilitated by the
                    constant surge of discussions, consultations and publications in esteemed and high impact journals.
                    Besides, there has been considerable progression of tangible and scholastic infrastructure which in
                    process provides an impetus to its bright future.

                    <p>Humanities and Social Science Department, IIT Roorkee</p>

            </div>

            <div class="hod__note">
                <h3>HOD’s Note</h3>
                <p>The above-quoted verse very aptly indicates the value of finer sensibilities in one’s life. Hence,
                    the education which only helps us grow mechanically, without sensitivity to human feelings and
                    problems, is not only inappropriate but also inadequate and misguided.<br /><br />

                    Probably this thinking may have led to the idea of having a strong input of humanities and social
                    sciences alongside the study of engineering and technology. The humanities and social sciences
                    component acts like a vital cog in the engineering and technology institutions as it keeps the finer
                    sensibilities and social responsibilities alive in engineers paving the way for a composite,
                    sustainable and desirable development which venerates the environment as well as human sensitivity
                    while promoting excellence in science and technology.<br /><br />

                    Department of Humanities & Social Sciences, IIT Roorkee, established in the year 1966 with a vision
                    to integrate science and technology with human values and social understanding, has taken giant
                    strides by contributing significantly to the making of engineers and technocrats who are alive to
                    and aware of their role in nation building and responsibilities towards mankind.<br /><br />

                    By imparting skill-based courses in Economics, English, Psychology and Sociology, the department
                    endeavours to form well-rounded individuals. It targets both the timely and timeless needs of the
                    students as it fills them with the much-needed job-ready skills and values that make them desirable
                    as individuals. The Department has grown many-folds since its inception.<br /><br />
                    Apart from offering core courses in all its broad areas, the department also offers some optional
                    and evening courses to the students of the institute. In the year 2016, the department started a
                    two-year M.Sc. programme in Economics which has got a very enthusiastic response.

                    The department has a very strong research unit comprising over 100 students working in diverse areas
                    of their core competencies as well as in the interdisciplinary domains. The department has world
                    class faculty who have been contributing their research to renowned national and international
                    journals and have significant linkages to the industry and other sister institutions.<br /><br />

                    It has a distinguished record in both teaching and research as many of the faculty members have been
                    conferred with prestigious awards at national and international levels. Several faculty members
                    serve on the editorial boards of national and international journals, as office bearers in boards
                    and associations, review articles for journals on a regular basis, and organize symposia,
                    conferences, workshops and short-term courses apart from offering NPTEL courses.<br /><br />

                    The department has excellent infrastructural support for carrying out quality research as it is
                    equipped with state of the art Communication Research and Training Laboratory, a Psychology
                    Laboratory, an Economic Database, Computer Laboratory and a well-stocked Department Library. I
                    invite all of you to join this joyful academic ride together and enrich and get enriched by the
                    meaningful academic exchanges.<br /><br />

                    With best regards,<br /><br />
